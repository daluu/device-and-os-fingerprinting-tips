Occasionally online search for user agent strings of device/model/OS of interest and see what the user agent 
monitoring/repository websites (e.g. http://whatismybrowser.com , http://useragentstring.com, etc.) present. 
Sometimes you come across info on reddit, github, StackOverflow, and public issue/bug reports, e.g:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/j620vi/user_agent_strings_of_playstation_5/
